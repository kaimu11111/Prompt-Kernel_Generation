Okay, let's tackle this problem step by step. The user wants an optimized CUDA kernel for ReLU that addresses the given feedback and is different from the existing kernels. Let me start by understanding the original code and the feedback provided.

First, looking at the original kernel (Kernel 1), it's a straightforward ReLU implementation where each thread processes a single element. The second kernel (Kernel 2) tries to process four elements per thread using __ldg and some unrolling. The feedback suggests changing the assignment to use max(0.f, x[idx]) and adding a loop with idx += gridDim.x * blockDim.x. That loop is a common optimization technique called grid-stride looping, which allows the kernel to handle larger arrays beyond the initial grid size by iterating over the data in chunks.

The target GPU is a Quadro RTX 6000 with Turing architecture. Since it doesn't support TF32, we need to stick to FP32. The feedback's suggestion to use max() instead of the ternary operator might be for performance, as max is a single instruction, whereas the ternary might have a branch. Also, using grid-stride looping can help in cases where the number of elements is less than the total threads, but more importantly, it allows better utilization when the grid size isn't perfectly calculated, though that's less likely here.

Now, the existing kernels have their own approaches. Kernel 2 uses __ldg for L1 cache loading, which can be beneficial for read-only data. However, the new kernel needs to be different. The user also mentioned that the new kernel must not just adjust constants or reorder lines but be meaningfully different.

The feedback's main points are to use max instead of the ternary and add a loop. So, integrating that into a new kernel structure. Let's consider using grid-stride looping here. The loop would let each thread process multiple elements, which can help in cases where the array size is smaller than the total number of threads (though that's edge case), but more importantly, it can allow better coalescing and reduce the overhead of calculating the exact grid size.

Another thing to consider is memory access patterns. The existing Kernel 2 uses 4 elements per thread but with __ldg. Maybe we can combine the grid-stride approach with a vectorized load, like using float4 or something similar to load multiple elements at once. However, since the target is Turing, which supports FP16 tensor cores but not FP8, and the problem is in FP32, vectorization might still be beneficial.

Wait, the original kernel uses 256 threads per block, and Kernel 2 uses 512. Maybe increasing the block size can improve occupancy. The Quadro RTX 6000 has 48 SMs, each with a maximum of 32 thread blocks. So, using a block size that's a multiple of the warp size (32) and perhaps higher than 256 could help. Let's check the maximum number of registers. The feedback doesn't mention register usage, so assuming that the code is okay. The maximum per thread is 255, so even if we use a few registers, it's okay.

Let me structure the new kernel with grid-stride looping. The loop would start at the thread's initial index and then increment by the total number of threads (gridDim.x * blockDim.x) each iteration. That way, each thread processes elements spaced out by the total threads, allowing multiple passes if needed.

Also, the feedback suggested using max(), so replacing the ternary with max(0.f, x[idx]).

Now, for vectorization: if we can process multiple elements per thread, that could reduce the number of threads needed. For example, using a block size of 256 and each thread processes 4 elements, that's equivalent to a block size of 1024, but without increasing the block size. However, the Quadro RTX 6000's maximum block size is 1024 threads per block. So maybe increasing the block size to 512 and using some unrolling.

Alternatively, using a block size of 256 and in the kernel, each thread processes 4 elements via unrolling. That would process 4 elements per thread. The grid-stride loop would then handle any overflow beyond the initial stride.

Wait, the existing Kernel 2 already does some unrolling with 4 elements per thread. The user wants the new kernel to be meaningfully different, so maybe combine the grid-stride approach with the unrolling. Let's see.

The new kernel could do both: use grid-stride looping so each thread processes multiple elements in a loop, and within each iteration, process four elements via unrolling, similar to Kernel 2 but with the loop added.

Alternatively, maybe combine the grid-stride with a coalesced memory access pattern. For example, using shared memory to coalesce reads, but that might complicate things. Since the data is read-only, __ldg might still be better. However, the first kernel doesn't use __ldg, so using __ldg in the new kernel would be a change.

Wait, the feedback didn't mention __ldg. The user's existing kernels have two versions: one without __ldg and one with. The new kernel needs to be different from both. Since Kernel 2 uses __ldg and unrolling, perhaps the new kernel can use grid-stride with __ldg and some unrolling, but structured differently.

Alternatively, perhaps use a higher block size (like 512) and process 4 elements per thread with grid-stride. Let me outline the steps:

1. Start with the grid-stride loop: idx = threadIdx.x + blockIdx.x * blockDim.x; then in a loop, process that element, then idx += blockDim.x * gridDim.x.

2. Within each loop iteration, process 4 elements at once (if possible). For example, using a loop unroll for 4 elements. So each thread would process 4 elements per grid-stride iteration.

Alternatively, the grid-stride loop can process elements in chunks, but with the unrolling, it might be more efficient.

Wait, the grid-stride loop allows threads to process multiple elements by iterating over the array in chunks. If we combine that with processing 4 elements per thread, each thread can handle 4 elements each time through the loop, which would multiply the throughput.

So putting it all together:

- Kernel uses grid-stride looping with a loop.
- Each thread in each loop iteration processes 4 elements (like Kernel 2's approach).
- Use __ldg for faster reads.
- Use max() instead of ternary.
- Block size could be higher than 256 to maximize occupancy. Let's check the maximum threads per block is 1024. Let's pick 512.

Now, the code structure:

The kernel would look something like this:

__global__ void relu_kernel(const float* __restrict__ x, float* __restrict__ out, int64_t size) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    while (idx < size) {
        float val = __ldg(x + idx);
        out[idx] = max(0.f, val);
        idx += blockDim.x * gridDim.x; // grid-stride
    }
}

But that's per element. To do unrolling, perhaps:

for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    int pos = idx + i;
    if (pos < size) {
        out[pos] = max(0.f, __ldg(x + pos));
    }
}
idx += 4 * (blockDim.x * gridDim.x);

Wait, but the loop would then process in chunks of 4. Alternatively, unroll within the loop:

Inside the loop:

int stride = blockDim.x * gridDim.x;
for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    int pos = idx + i;
    if (pos < size) {
        out[pos] = max(0.f, __ldg(x + pos));
    }
}
idx += 4 * stride;

This way, each thread handles 4 elements per grid-stride iteration.

But this requires that the total threads * 4 can cover the size. Alternatively, the unrolling can be done without the loop, but the grid-stride loop is still there.

Hmm, perhaps a better approach is to have the thread process 4 elements at once using unrolling, and then step through the array with grid-stride.

So the loop would be:

int stride = blockDim.x * gridDim.x;
for (int i = 0; i < 4; ++i) {
    int pos = idx + i;
    if (pos < size) {
        out[pos] = max(0.f, __ldg(x + pos));
    }
}
idx += 4 * stride;

Wait, but the loop would be inside the grid-stride loop. Wait no, the outer loop is the grid-stride loop, so each iteration of that loop processes the next chunk. So the thread would process 4 elements each time through the grid-stride loop.

Alternatively, perhaps the grid-stride loop can handle the overall stepping, while the unrolling is done once per iteration.

Wait, perhaps the code structure would be:

int stride = blockDim.x * gridDim.x;
for (int pos = idx; pos < size; pos += stride) {
    // process 4 elements here
}

Inside the pos loop, process four elements at a time. But that could be more efficient.

Alternatively, to unroll 4 elements, in each grid-stride step, process four elements:

In each iteration of the grid-stride loop:

int pos = idx;
for (int i=0; i<4; i++) {
    if (pos < size) {
        out[pos] = max(0, x[pos]);
        pos++;
    } else {
        break; // or handle all 4
    }
}
idx += stride;

But the problem is that the loop for 4 elements may have to check each position. However, this could be done with unrolling to avoid the inner loop.

Unrolling it:

int pos0 = pos;
int pos1 = pos0 + 1;
int pos2 = pos0 + 2;
int pos3 = pos0 + 3;

if (pos0 < size) { ... }
if (pos1 < size) { ... }
// etc.

This way, the code doesn't have an inner loop and can process up to 4 elements each grid-stride step.

Putting this together, the kernel would look like:

__global__ void relu_kernel(const float* __restrict__ x, float* __restrict__ out, int64_t size) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int stride = blockDim.x * gridDim.x;

    while (idx < size) {
        int pos0 = idx;
        int pos1 = idx + 1;
        int pos2 = idx + 2;
        int pos3 = idx + 3;

        if (pos0 < size) {
            out[pos0] = max(0.f, __ldg(x + pos0));
        }
        if (pos1 < size) {
            out[pos1] = max(0.f, __ldg(x + pos1));
        }
        if (pos2 < size) {
            out[pos2] = max(0.f, __ldg(x + pos2));
        }
        if (pos3 < size) {
            out[pos3] = max(0.f, __ldg(x + pos3));
        }
        idx += stride * 4; // because each thread handles 4 elements per step
    }
}

Wait, but in this case, the stride is multiplied by 4 because each thread is now responsible for 4 elements. The grid-stride loop increments by stride *4, so the next iteration's idx is the next set of 4 elements spaced by the total threads *4.

Wait, no. Let me think again:

The original grid-stride loop steps by stride (blockDim.x * gridDim.x). That way, each thread processes elements spaced by the total number of threads. Adding unrolling of 4 elements would mean that each thread processes 4 elements per grid-stride iteration. So the stride for the loop should remain as before, but the thread handles 4 elements in each step.

Wait, no, the idx is being incremented by stride *4? That would make each thread process elements 4 steps apart. Hmm, perhaps the correct way is to increment by stride each time, but in each iteration, the thread handles 4 elements. So:

idx starts at the initial position. In each iteration, the thread processes elements idx, idx+1, idx+2, idx+3 (if within bounds), then increments by stride. So the next iteration's idx is the same as the previous + stride, but the processing is done in the next chunk.

Wait, but in the code above, after processing the 4 elements, the idx is increased by stride *4. That would mean the next elements are 4*stride away, but that's incorrect. Because the next step should be the next element in the global array, but spaced by stride. Hmm, perhaps the stride is the same as before, but the thread handles 4 elements each time.

Wait, perhaps the code should be:

The grid-stride loop is:

while (idx < size) {
    process 4 elements here (idx, idx+1, idx+2, idx+3)
    idx += stride; // same as before, since each thread handles 4 elements in each step
}

Wait, but then each thread is responsible for 4 elements per step. The stride is the same, so each thread's step is the same, but in each iteration, they handle 4 elements. That way, the total number of threads needed would be size/(4*threads_per_block) ?

Hmm, this might be better. Let's see.

Let's say the block size is 256. The stride is 256 * gridDim.x. Each thread in each loop iteration processes 4 elements. So, the total elements per thread per iteration is 4, so the total number of threads can be divided by 4. But the key is that the grid-stride loop allows each thread to process multiple elements in a loop, so even if the array is larger than the initial grid, it's handled.

The advantage here is that using __ldg and unrolling the 4 elements can improve memory throughput, and the grid-stride loop handles the overflow.

So, the kernel code would look like this, using the unrolling of 4 elements and the grid-stride loop.

Also, using __restrict__ on the pointers to hint the compiler about no aliasing, which is good practice.

Now, for the block size: the existing kernels used 256 and 512. Let's pick a larger block size, say 512, to increase occupancy. The maximum block size is 1024, but 512 is a good balance. Let me check the maximum number of registers per thread. The code uses a few variables (idx, stride, pos0-3, etc.), so probably under 255.

Now, the kernel launcher would compute the number of blocks as (size + (block_size*4 -1 )) / (block_size *4), but no, because the unrolling is 4 elements per thread. Wait, actually, the block size is chosen as usual, and the unrolling is per thread. So the number of blocks can be computed as before: (size + block_size -1)/block_size.

Wait, no, because each thread processes 4 elements each iteration. So the total number of threads required is ceil(size /4). So the number of blocks would be ceil(ceil(size/4)/block_size). But the grid-stride loop takes care of the rest. So the block size can be set to 512, and the number of blocks is (size /4 + block_size -1)/block_size.

Alternatively, perhaps it's better to compute it as (size + block_size -1)/block_size, since the grid-stride loop will handle the unrolling. Wait, the grid-stride loop ensures that all elements are covered, so the initial grid calculation can be done as usual. The unrolling just means each thread does more work, but the initial grid size is the same as if they were doing one element per thread. However, that might lead to redundant threads. Alternatively, the grid size could be ceil(ceil(size)/ (4 * threads)), but this complicates.

Alternatively, to minimize the number of threads, since each thread handles 4 elements, the number of threads needed is ceil(size /4). So the block size can be 512, so the number of blocks would be ceil(ceil(size/4) /512). But this may complicate the code, so perhaps just use the standard grid calculation.

The launcher can compute:

num_blocks = (size + block_size -1)/block_size;

But since each thread processes 4 elements, the total threads is block_size*num_blocks, but each can handle 4 elements, so the total capacity is 4*block_size*num_blocks, so as long as that's >= size, it's okay. The grid-stride loop will handle the exact coverage.

Therefore, the code can proceed with the standard block and grid calculation.

Now, putting all together.

The kernel will have the grid-stride loop with unrolling of 4 elements, using __ldg and max.

The code would look like:

__global__ void relu_kernel(const float* __restrict__ x, float* __restrict__ out, int64_t size) {
    int idx = blockIdx.x * blockDim.x + threadIdx.x;
    int stride = blockDim.x * gridDim.x;

    while (idx < size) {
        int pos0 = idx;
        int pos1 = pos0 + 1;
        int pos2 = pos0 + 2;
        int pos3 = pos0 + 3;

        if (pos0 < size) {
            out[pos0] = max(0.f, __ldg(x + pos0));
        }
        if (pos1 < size) {
            out[pos1] = max(0.f, __ldg(x + pos1));
        }
        if (pos2 < size) {
            out[pos2] = max(0.f, __ldg(x + pos2));
        }
        if (pos3 < size) {
            out[pos3] = max(0.f, __ldg(x + pos3));
        }
        idx += stride;
    }
}

The block size is set to 512 in the launcher. Let's see:

In the launcher function:

const int block_size = 512;
int num_blocks = (size + block_size -1) / block_size;

This should be okay.

Now, checking for differences from existing kernels:

Kernel1 uses a simple per-element approach without unrolling or grid-stride.

Kernel2 uses unrolling of 4 elements per thread but without the grid-stride loop. Instead, it uses a base = idx*4 and checks if base is under size, then does the four elements. But the grid-stride loop is not there. So combining unrolling with grid-stride is different.

This new kernel uses both unrolling and grid-stride, which is different from both previous kernels. That meets the requirement.

Another point: the original feedback's first suggestion was to replace the ternary with max(0.f, x[idx]). So that's done here.

The second part of the feedback is the loop with idx += gridDim.x * blockDim.x, which is implemented via the grid-stride loop (idx += stride, which is exactly blockDim.x * gridDim.x).

So the code addresses the feedback points.

Now, considering possible optimizations:

- Using __ldg is better for read-only data, which is the case here.

- The unrolling of four elements can improve memory throughput and reduce the number of threads needed, leading to better occupancy.

- The grid-stride loop ensures that all elements are processed even if the initial grid is smaller than needed, though in most cases the grid is computed correctly.

Potential issues:

- The unrolling adds some conditionals (if pos0 < size, etc.), which could introduce divergence if the array size is not a multiple of 4. For example, near the end, some threads may process fewer than four elements. But since each thread is handling consecutive elements, the divergence within a warp could be minimal if the array size is aligned. However, the code is designed to handle that with the conditionals.

- The max function is a single instruction, so that's better than the ternary which might have a branch.

Now, the kernel is different from the existing ones and incorporates all the feedback. The code seems solid.

Now, writing the Python wrapper as per the requirements.

The code must include imports, source as a triple-quoted string, cpp_src, load_inline, and the model class.

The source should be the CUDA code with the kernel and the launcher.

The cpp_src is the declaration of the custom_relu_cuda function.

The load_inline is called with the correct parameters.

The model class uses the loaded function.

Putting it all together in Python:

The CUDA code's source includes the kernel and the launcher function. The launcher uses block_size=512.

Thus, the final code should look like this.
